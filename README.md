# Algorithms Exploration: Cubing Workflow  
  
  
As a child, I absolutely hated puzzles. In fact, I hated the rubik's cube the most; the thought of simply touching it made me shudder. I believed that if I touched it, the cube's perfectly coloured faces would become distorted and I would never be able to put them back together again. As if solving the cube required casting an impossible magic.  

It took me a long time to gather the courage to solve the rubik's cube. In the hot summer of 2020, I decided that I will attempt to solve the cube by watching a YouTube tutorial. I'm not ashamed to admit that I took three whole days to complete my first solve. I was so happy that day. I knew that if my child self had witnessed this moment, she would be proud of me.   
  I have continued to cube ever since.

Today I can solve the 3Ã—3 rubik's cube in under a minute. Now, I'd like to branch out and tackle a different puzzle, and this assignment is the perfect opportunity for me to develop my cubing abilities. Through this assignment I learned that such thing as a pyraminx exists. I decided to tackle 3 new puzzles: A regular pyraminx, pyraminx duo and lastly pyraminx boomerang. This file's purpose is to display the progression of my cubing skills, the algorithms used to solve the puzzles are mentioned later in the file.
Enjoy :)

 | Type of cube  |Can I solve it? | Did I reach my goal? | What is my next goal? | AO5 (sec) | AO12 (sec) | AO25 (sec) | Best Time  | 
 | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
 | Cube 3x3  | Yes | I successfully reached my goal of solving the cube under a minute during August 2021, one thing I learned is that the type of cube you use really matters, some cubes are more stiff and difficult to play around with. | My next goal is to solve the 3x3 rubik's cube in under 45 seconds. | 1:01.23 | 1:04.77 | 1:05.89 | 53.11 | 
 | Pyraminx duo  | Yes  | I successfully reached my goal of solving the pyraminx duo in under 10 seconds during the first week of starting this assignment. | My next goal is to solve the pyraminx duo within 5 seconds. | 2.92  | 4.78  | 5.43  | 3.34  | 
| Pyraminx boomerang   | Yes | I successfully reached my goal of solving the pyraminx boomerang within 30 seconds yesterday on 19-10-2022. | My next goal is to try and solve the pyraminx boomerang within 15 seconds. | 14.90 | 15.45  | 17.70  | 7.29  |
| Pyraminx  | Yes | I successfully reached my goal of solving the pyraminx at under 30 seconds at the start of the week on 17-10-2022. | My next goal is to solve the pyraminx within 20 seconds. | 18.34  | 20.34  | 19.77  | 18.01  |  

  
  **Algorithm used to solve the 3x3 rubik's cube: Advanced CFOP / Fridrich Method**  
> prior knowledge of cubing algorithms and cube faces is required.  
1. The steps involve building the foundations for the first two layers and then pairing up pieces before inserting them around the foundations to solve the first two layers. Then the last layer is tackled by learning the algorithms to solve the cube in two extra steps.
